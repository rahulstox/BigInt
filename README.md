# BigInt

BigInt C++ Library

This C++ library provides a data type called BigInt for dealing with arbitrarily large integers. The library includes basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation, square root, and comparison between two BigInts. Additionally, it offers functionalities like calculating Fibonacci numbers, factorials, and Catalan numbers for large inputs.

Features:
1.Add two big integers.
2.Subtract two big integers
3.Multiply two big integers.
4.Divide two big integers.
5.Modulo two big integers
6.Raise a big integer to a power
7.The square root of a big integer
8.Comparison between two big integers to check which is greater and which is smaller.
9.Find the number of digits in the big integer.
10.Print the big integer.
11.Convert an integer to a big integer.


Applications
Large Number Arithmetic: BigInts are useful for scenarios where integers exceed the capacity of native data types.
Number Theory: Calculating Fibonacci, factorial, and Catalan numbers for large inputs.
Cryptography: BigInts are fundamental for cryptographic algorithms that involve large prime numbers and modular arithmetic.
